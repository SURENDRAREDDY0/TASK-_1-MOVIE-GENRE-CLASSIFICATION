IT CLASSIFIES THE MOVIES BASED ON THERE GENRE
Movie genre classification is the process of categorizing movies into different genres based on their themes, plot, setting, and other elements. Genres are used to group similar movies together, making it easier for audiences to find movies that match their interests.

Some common movie genres include:

1. Action: Movies with intense physical feats, fights, and stunts.
2. Adventure: Movies that involve exciting journeys or quests.
3. Comedy: Movies intended to make the audience laugh through humorous situations and dialogue.
4. Drama: Movies that focus on realistic and serious themes, often exploring complex emotions and relationships.
5. Romance: Movies that revolve around love, relationships, and emotional connections.
6. Horror: Movies that aim to scare or frighten the audience, often featuring supernatural or suspenseful elements.
7. Science Fiction: Movies that explore futuristic or speculative concepts, often involving advanced technology or space travel.
8. Fantasy: Movies that feature magical or supernatural elements set in imaginary worlds.
9. Thriller: Movies that create suspense and tension, often involving crime, mystery, or psychological elements.
10. Animation: Movies created using animation techniques, often targeted at younger audiences but can also appeal to all age groups.

These are just a few examples of movie genres, and there are many sub-genres and hybrid genres that exist as well. Movie genre classification helps audiences navigate the vast variety of films available and allows filmmakers to target specific audiences with their creations.
